# S3DS
S3DS stands for Ultra-Sonic 3D Scanner, The main objective of this code is a proof of concept to make a 3D scanner with Ultra-Sonic sensors and to study about C matrixes/arrays manipulation and C communication with an Arduino and 3D rendering with raylib.

# Install
Flash trough the Arduino IDE the file sender.c, or with any tool of your like.
Then compile and run the serial_sender.c and with new updates, the mesh.c to show with raylib a mesh 3D graph.
